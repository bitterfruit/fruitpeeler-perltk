crackDpck v0.34 readme.txt

Installation & upgrade

  the short version:

     extract fp034, run the install.sh script and follow the instructions.

  the long versions:

  Ubuntu:
   - Make sure you have closed down crackDpck before installing.
   - Extract downloaded file fp034.rar to your home directory.
   - open a console and move to the home directory and fruitpeeler
     directory (cd ~/fruitpeeler)
   - To launch the install script, write: sudo ./install.sh
   - The script should now ask you yes or no on packages to install.
     These packages are required. Answering no will abort the script:
        packages: perl, perl-tk, p7zip-full.

     Note:
       - On RAR versions less than 4.00, and the unrar-free package:
         Rar v3.96 doesn't handle weird chars very well (weird passwords).
         The installation will prompt you (yes or no) for installing the
         propper unrar from rarlab.com. Answer yes to download and install it.
       - package zenity probably comes with ubuntu. Without zenity the
         ChooseDirectory dialog windows will look uuglaay.

  Cygwin:
    - Make sure you have closed down crackDpck before installing.
    - Extract downloaded file fp034.rar to your home directory.
    - open a console and move to the homedirectory and fruitpeeler
      directory (cd ~/fruitpeeler)
    - To launch the install script, write: ./install.sh
    - With Cygwin's Setup-x86.exe you will need to get the following packages:
       Packages: perl, perl-tk, xinit(X11), p7zip. Optional: perl-Win32-GUI
    - The script will tell you what packages you are missing, if any.
    - The script asks you if you want a bat file on your desktop to launch the script.

    - You will also need to install WinRAR from rarlab.com if you haven't got WinRAR.
      Note: The WinRAR from rarlab.com is not 100% compatible with cygwin.
      With it you will experience problems with RAR archives with doublequotes used in
      passwords. Advanced Tip: Download the unrar sourcode from rarlab.com's extras section.
      Compile unrar.exe and move it to the root of your home directory. Now you have
      a 100% cygwin compatible and updates unrar program that handles passwords
      with doublequotes.

        Make sure xwin is loaded before starting crackDpck on Cygwin.

Uninstallation:

   short version: run the uninstall.sh script.

   long t-spoon version:

   - Make sure you have closed down crackDpck before installing.
   - Extract downloaded file fp034.rar to your home directory if you have deleted
     the fruitpeeler directory in your home directory.
   - open a console and move to the home directory and fruitpeeler
     directory (cd ~/fruitpeeler)
   - To launch the uninstall script write: ./uninstall.sh
