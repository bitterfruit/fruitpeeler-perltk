FruitPeeler v0.36 readme.txt

Fruitpeeler is a archive extracting tool with GUI written in perl-tk.
FruitPeeler utilizes unrar/7z/zip found on the system.
The user has the option to add passwords in a text box to easy the
extraction and decryption process.

What fruitpeeler is not: FruitPeeler is not a cracker/bruteforce tool,
for that purpose fruitpeeler is too slow anyway.


Installation & upgrade

  the short version:

     Extract fp036.rar, run the install.sh script with root access (sudo), and
     follow the instructions.

  the long versions:

  Ubuntu:
   - Make sure you have closed down FruitPeeler before installing.
   - Extract downloaded file fp036.rar to your home directory.
   - Open a console and move to the home directory and fruitpeeler
     directory (cd ~/fruitpeeler)
   - To launch the install script, write: sudo ./install.sh
   - The script should now ask you yes or no on packages to install.
     These packages are required. Answering no will abort the script:
        packages: perl, perl-tk, p7zip-full.

     Note:
       - On RAR versions less than 4.00, and the unrar-free package:
         Rar v3.96 doesn't handle weird chars very well (weird passwords).
       - package zenity probably comes with ubuntu. Without zenity the
         ChooseDirectory dialog windows will look uuglaay.

  Cygwin:
    - Make sure you have closed down FruitPeeler before installing.
    - Extract downloaded file fp036.rar to your home directory.
    - Open a console and move to the homedirectory and fruitpeeler
      directory (cd ~/fruitpeeler)
    - To launch the install script, write: ./install.sh
    - With Cygwin's Setup-x86.exe you will need to get the following packages:
       Packages: perl, perl-tk, xinit(X11), p7zip. Optional: perl-Win32-GUI
    - The script will tell you what packages you are missing, if any.
    - The script asks you if you want a bat file on your desktop to launch the script.

    - You will also need to install WinRAR from rarlab.com if you haven't got WinRAR.
      Note: The WinRAR from rarlab.com is not 100% compatible with cygwin.
      With it you will experience problems with RAR archives with doublequotes used in
      passwords. Advanced Tip: Download the unrar sourcode from rarlab.com's extras section.
      Compile unrar.exe and move it to the root of your home directory. Now you have
      a 100% cygwin compatible and updates unrar program that handles passwords
      with doublequotes.

        Make sure xwin is loaded before starting FruitPeeler on Cygwin.


Uninstallation (Cygwwin & ubuntu):

   short version: run the uninstall.sh script.

   long t-spoon version:

   - Make sure you have closed down FruitPeeler before installing.
   - Extract downloaded file fp034.rar to your home directory if you have deleted
     the fruitpeeler directory in your home directory.
   - open a console and move to the home directory and fruitpeeler
     directory (cd ~/fruitpeeler)
   - To launch the uninstall script write: ./uninstall.sh
     On ubuntu you may need to write: sudo ./uninstall.sh
