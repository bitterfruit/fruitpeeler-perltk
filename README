FruitPeeler README

Fruitpeeler is a archive extracting tool with GUI written in perl-tk.
FruitPeeler utilizes unrar/7z/zip found on the system.
The user has the option to add passwords in a text box to easy the
extraction and decryption process.

What fruitpeeler is not: FruitPeeler is not a cracker/bruteforce tool,
for that purpose fruitpeeler is too slow anyway.


Installation & upgrade

  - Installation using command-lines and wget
       wget https://github.com/bitterfruit/fruitpeeler-perltk/archive/master.zip
       unzip master.zip && rm -v master.zip
       cd fruitpeeler-perltk-master/
       sudo ./install.sh
         (drop the sudo on Cygwin)

    or

  - Click the "Download ZIP" button on GitHub to download FruitPeeler.

  Ubuntu:
    - Extract the zip file and run the install script:
         sudo ./install.sh
    - The script should now ask you yes or no on packages to install.
      These packages are required. Answering no will abort the script:
         packages: perl, perl-tk, p7zip-full.

      Note:
        - On RAR versions less than 4.00, and the unrar-free package:
          Rar v3.96 doesn't handle weird chars very well (weird passwords).
        - package zenity probably comes with ubuntu. Without zenity the
          ChooseDirectory dialog windows will look uuglaay.

  Cygwin:
    - Extract the zip file and run the install script:
         ./install.sh
    - The script will tell you what packages you are missing, if any.
      With Cygwin's Setup-x86.exe you will need to get the following packages:
         Packages: perl, perl-tk, xinit, p7zip. Optional: perl-Win32-GUI

    - You will also need to install WinRAR from rarlab.com if you haven't
      got it. WinRAR from rarlab.com is not 100% compatible with Cygwin.
      Known problems with WinRAR and Cygwin: RAR archives with doublequotes used
      in passwords.
          Advanced Tip: Download the unrar sourcode from rarlab.com's
      extras section. Compile unrar.exe and move it to the root of your home
      directory, or install it. Now you have a 100% cygwin compatible and
      updates unrar program that handles passwords with doublequotes.
      Assuming that you have installed the package make and gnu-gcc, this
      is how you can compile and install it:
          make
          make install

Uninstallation (Cygwwin & ubuntu):

    Run the uninstall.sh script. Use sudo on ubuntu.
