  - Show versions of rar/unrar/7z programs.
- Fruitpeeler moved to /usr/local/bin .


0.35(20140117)
install.sh
- Installing rar and unrar from rarlab's website cause conflict with file-roller's
  choice of rar/unrar. Moving /usr/local/bin/rar and /usr/local/bin/unrar to
  your home folder for example will solve that problem. It's nice to have
  unrar 5.01 because the rar format has changed in version 5.x.
- The script checks if you've got the ubuntu packages rar or unrar. One of those are
  good enough for fruitpeeler. If non of those are present, the script will ask the
  user a y/n question to install the unrar package. The package unrar in the ubuntu
  repositories is now at 4.00 beta 3 freeware, and that is more than good enough for
  fruitpeeler. It used to be 3.94, and that caused problems with unicode in filenames
  and passwords, and that is why we used to install rar from rarlab manually.
fruitpeeler.pl
- improved clasification of what rar software is installed on ubuntu. The problem
  is that the ubuntu packages unrar and unrar-free will have the same command name
  (unrar), and we do not want the unrar-free because it is ancient. The script now
  ignores it. The script will choose unrar in home directory over anything
  else, and if unrar is not present it will look for rar. If no rar program are
  present, fruitpeeler won't start.

0.34(20140115)
install.sh:
- checks for missing packages
- ubuntu-only: can install missing packages.
- cygwin-only: notify of missing packages.
- copy a launch icon to desktop (new on cygwin)
fruitpeeler:
- recursive search. look for archives in dirs deeper than one level.
  this means much fancier directory structures on the destination!
- Propper (!) ChooseDirectory dialog for selecting source or destination folder.
  This was requested years ago, but today I got an epiphany!
  Note: The packages zenity on ubuntu or perl-Win32-GUI on Cygwin are optional, but
        without them you get the uuglaay ChooseDirectory dialog that comes with
        the ancient perl-tk. On ubuntu zenity comes with the OS.
- improved load configuration function when config file (.fruitpeeler) is missing.
- improved algorithm to determine current OS.

0.32(20120620)
- Cygwin-only: Support for passwords with " doublequotes in them. This will only
  work if you compile unrar.exe from rarlab. Added usage of unrar.exe if located in
  home directory. This allows for making and using of rarlab's unrar.exe using their
  sourcode and makefile. To make unrar.exe write "make -f unrar.unix".
  See this website for more info:
    http://oscarvalles.wordpress.com/2009/08/21/extracting-rar-files-in-cygwin/

0.31(20111008)
- Support for looong passwords.
- Accept winrar error message (exit value) 9, to not get stuck when extracting
  wierd behaviour in filenames from unix platforms.

0.30(20110519)
- Added Checkbutton option for creating folders in destination based on
  folders selected for extraction in source. Example: Folder "docs" selected,
  Extract to Destination selected, create folders in dest selected, and
  CreateFolders selected, then the archives in "docs" will be extracted to 
  /{destinationpath}/docs/{rarfilename}/
- Fixed: Dirs in the listbox who contain archives did get bold font even if the
  first part of a multi-part archive was missing.
- Added handling of passwords with $-chars (needed escaping).
- Cygwin: Added proper handling of unix-paths (/home/user/ etc.) using cygwin's
  cygpath command. I'm caching the command because its relatively slow.

0.29(20110429)
- Added Window Adjuster between the filelist and the password list.
- Added Window Resize. Adjuster is anchored to the password list when resizing.
- Added font-styles to dirs and files in the listbox.
- Dirs in the listbox who contain archives are displayed with bold text.
- Fixed problem with dirnames with dots who doesnt show up in the lister.
- Changed directory sorting to case-insenstive sorting.
- Prevent change of path when users tries to empty path select in the
  drop-down lists.
- Added handling of utf8 dir- and filenames. 

0.28(20110419)
- Fixed problem with double quotes in passwords. On Ubuntu, all "
  in passwords are replaced by \". This works, but on Cygwin it is not
  that easy if you are using win32 native rar.exe (one is not supposed
  to mix win32 and cygwin native executables, but we do so anyway).
  In windows batch files (.bat) the problem is solved by replacing "
  with "", but this doesn't work with win32 rar.exe under cygwin sh-shell.
  I have noted before that I want to use the right tool for the job
  (rar for rar and p7zip for 7z/zip), but in this special case I'm using
  p7zip for rars if the password has " char. p7zip can handle rar's too
  and it is compiled for cygwin, and therefor have no compatibility issues.

0.27(20110411)
- Added directory browsing in the filelist when double-clicking items.
  I also put a ".." in the filelist to be able to browse backwards.
  If an dir-entry in the filelist is changed since last refresh_filelist,
  then the double-clicked of such an item will refresh the filelist.
- Added 'select all files' event when Control-Key-a pressed.
- Added images on buttons.
- Added search for executable /home/user/rar/rar .
- Fixed bug when searching for exec. (cdp thought dirs where files).

0.26(20110404)
- Ubuntu-only: Installer and uninstaller improved. Installation of 
  required packages (perl-tk, rar and p7zip-full) are now conveniently
  executed in the installation script install.sh.
  --> Double click install.sh and then click "Run in Terminal".
- Improved dropdown lists. Devices and volumes are added on the fly.
  Home path is marked green, and paths added on the fly are marked blue.
    Ubuntu: homedir, removable devices and truecrypt volumes.
    Cygwin: All capital letter volumes (/cygpath/c, d, e etc).
- Added image to Browse buttons.

0.25(20110401)
- Removed the -ed option in the rar extract command. It was causing some
  trouble on windows rar.exe (3.93 and 4.00) when trying to extract a 
  rar file created on ubuntu (unknown software tool used).

0.24(20110330)
- Fixed problem with deleting multipart files. The glob() function under
  cygwin(only) needed ' or " when a path had spaces, and required 
  that there had to be non ' or " when a path have no spaces hmm.
  Spaces in path given to glob() func are now replaced with escaped spaces,
  and this solves the problem for both systems.
- Fixed problem multipart-rar files. The Createfolder function in crackDpck
  did include the .part01 in its new folder name when extracting multipart-rar.
- Reverted change from v0.22. Creating dirs with rar didn't work
  without rightmost slash.
- cygwin-only: p7zip replaces WinRAR for extracting 7z and zip files.
  WinRAR.exe do support 7z files, but doesn't support split-7z files.
  Cygwin users need to install the free p7zip package thru cygwin's setup.exe.
- Fixed silly hash bang slash header not pointing at Perl.

0.23(20110327)
- added progress window.
- matching of files is now case insensitive.
- added handling of split-archives (*.7z.### and *.part##.rar etc.)
- fixed problem with deleting files located in paths with spaces. classic.

0.22(20110324)
- removed rightmost slash in output dir-name argument given to extractors. 

0.21(20110323)
- scanning actual files only (no symbolic links or devices).
- handles also 7z/zip files using WinRAR.exe (cygwin) or p7zip (ubuntu).

0.20(20110320)
- first time working under both cygwin and ubuntu.
- utf-8 transcoding of passnames when loading and saving cfg. (TK text widget
  use socalled wide-characters (more than 8bits) and needed to be tamed.
- Characters like ( ) & in passwords are escaped with a \ to please
  sh-shell when extracting. Works great.
- cygwin-only: cyg_path and win_path subrutines used to convert to/from
  windows-style pathnames at the very last moment befor calling native
  windows rar.

0.12(20110320)
- working history of source and destination paths, and check for existence
  of path when loading config from file.
- configuration loading and saving works.
- cygwin-only: default source and destination path is /cygdrive/
- cygwin-only: improved finding of rar.exe under cygwin.
